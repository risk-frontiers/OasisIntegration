# HailAUS 7: Risk Frontiers Australian Hailstorm model

## Overview
For 25 years, [Risk Frontiers][WEBSITE] has been leading the development of natural catastrophe models for the Asia-Pacific region.
Available on our Multi-Peril Workbench, HailAUS 7 is now offered through the Oasis loss modelling framework. HailAUS
enables users unparalleled quantification of risk at the location and portfolio level, having full national coverage
for property and motor insurance portfolios

## Key Facts
The HailAUS 7 has the following features:
- a large catalogue of stochastic hailstorm events (50,000 simulation years),
- a granular vulnerability with national coverage for property and motor exposures,
- dynamic and static motor vehicle exposure analysis mode.

The [key facts][VENDOR_MODEL_KF] document provides important information in a standardised form to help you start
working with the model as quickly as possible.

## Model Methodology
The [model methodology][VENDOR_MODEL_MM] document contains detailed information about how the model is built and
calibrated.

## Sample OED files
The following files are examples of [OED] format input files that work with this model.
- OED [loc file][OED_LOC]
- OED [acc file][OED_ACC]
